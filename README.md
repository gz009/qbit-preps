## Here is one of the responses:
Absolutely! Here's the learning roadmap for QBIT, drawing on my expertise in AI, Deep Learning, Quantum Information Science, Systems Biology, Systems Simulation, and Human Immune Systems:

### QBIT Learning Path

| Step | KA Type | Knowledge Area (KA) | Duration | % of Total | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Basic | Linear Algebra | 4 weeks | 10% | Foundation for Quantum Mechanics |
| 2 | Basic | Probability & Statistics | 4 weeks | 10% | Foundation for Quantum Information Theory |
| 3 | Concept | Introduction to Quantum Mechanics | 6 weeks | 15% | Core principles of qubits, superposition & entanglement |
| 4 | Skill |  Python Programming | 8 weeks | 20% | Tool for data manipulation, analysis & future coding needs |
| 5 | Skill |  Machine Learning Basics | 8 weeks | 20% |  Understanding patterns & making predictions |
| 6 | Concept |  Quantum Information Theory (QIT) | 8 weeks | 20% | Information processing & communication in quantum systems |
| 7 | Concept |  Systems Biology Fundamentals | 12 weeks | 25% | Biological processes modeled as interconnected networks |
| 8 | Skill |  Systems Simulation Tools | 8 weeks | 20% | Building & analyzing computational models of biological systems |
| 9 | Concept |  Human Immune System (HIS) Deep Dive | 12 weeks | 25% | Cellular & molecular mechanisms of immune response |
| 10 | Application |  QBIT and HIS: Research Papers & Reviews | Ongoing | - |  Exploring current research & potential applications  |

**Comments:**

* We've swapped "Entropy & Thermodynamics" for "Linear Algebra" as a stronger foundation for Quantum Mechanics. 
*  "Quantum Statistical Mechanics" was replaced with "Machine Learning Basics" as it provides a more relevant skill for data analysis in QBIT.
* We extended the duration for Systems Biology & HIS to ensure a deeper understanding. 
* Step 10 is ongoing to keep up with the rapidly evolving field of QBIT.

**Additional Tips:**

* Look for online courses and lectures by leading researchers in QBIT.
* Join online communities and forums related to QBIT to connect with other learners and experts.
* Consider taking a relevant specialization or Master's program in a related field. 

Remember, this is a roadmap, and you can adjust the pace and order based on your background and learning style. The key is to build a solid foundation in the core concepts and then delve deeper into specific areas of interest within QBIT.

# Benchmarking

If black box models do better than the white box model. Then try to improve the white box model.

We can not use the black box model in the Human Immune Systems modeling because we need to explain the models to the Living Human Beings.
